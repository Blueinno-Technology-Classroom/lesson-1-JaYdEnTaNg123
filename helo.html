    <h1>Into the wild</h1>
    For generations, four Clans of wild cats have shared the forest according to
    the laws laid down by their ancestors. But the warrior code has been
    threatened, and the ThunderClan cats are in grave danger. The sinister
    ShadowClan grows stronger every day. Noble warriors are dying—and some
    deaths are more mysterious than others. In the midst of this turmoil appears
    an ordinary housecat named Rusty… who may turn out to be the bravest warrior
    of them all.

    <h1>Fire and ice</h1>
    Deep in the heart of the forest, four Clans of warrior cats coexist in
    uneasy harmony—but uncertain times are upon them, and dangers threaten the
    precarious balance of the forest. Fireheart is a ThunderClan warrior now,
    but his troubles are far from over. The cats of rival RiverClan grow
    restless, while WindClan is weak and faces threats from all sides. Now
    Fireheart faces not only imminent battle, but betrayal from within his own
    Clan.
    <h1>Forest of Secret</h1>
    Allegiances are shifting among the Clans of warrior cats that roam the
    forest. With tensions so delicately balanced, friends can become enemies
    overnight, and some cats are willing to kill to get what they want.
    Fireheart is determined to find out the truth about the mysterious death of
    the former ThunderClan deputy Redtail. But as he searches for answers, he
    uncovers secrets that might be better-left hidden…
